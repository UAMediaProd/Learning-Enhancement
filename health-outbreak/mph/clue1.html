      <p>You are an Epidemiologist working in the Communicable Disease Control Branch, SA Health. Your role is to investigate an infections disease outbreak. We hope that you will
        be able to determine the cause of the outbreak and put control measures in place to prevent further cases of
        disease.The outbreak scenario is based on the <strong>Ten Steps to an outbreak investigation</strong>.

        <br><br>You will be given instructions (a clue) at each step of the investigation. The clue will direct you to complete a task,
        before moving onto the next clue. Complete all ten tasks in the order given, and do not move to the next clue until you have completed that clue. </p>
      <p>Here, you can enter your answer for each clue and when you feel ready, you'll be given the
        next clue and a link to the next entry page. <strong>You will need to copy and paste the responses to each clue in a word document as it cannot be saved on the entry page.</strong></p>
