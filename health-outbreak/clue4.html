      <p>You are a Public Health Officer for the Communicable Disease Control Branch, Oz State Department of Health. You
        are aiming to win the Amazing Outbreak Race by completing tasks of an outbreak scenario. We hope that you will
        be able to determine the cause of the outbreak and put control measures in place to prevent further cases of
        disease.The outbreak scenario will be based on the <strong>Ten Steps to an outbreak investigation</strong>.

        <br><br>You will be given instructions (a clue) at each station. The clue will direct you to complete a task,
        before moving onto the next station. Complete all ten tasks in the order given. </p>
      <p>Here, you can enter your answer for each clue and when you feel ready, you'll be given the
        next clue and a link to the next entry page.</p>
