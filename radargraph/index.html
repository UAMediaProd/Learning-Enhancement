                            <p>
                                Planning is a core activity in risk management. Planning and organisational skills are essential to being effective in the risk management process and in working with stakeholders. Taking time to understand the risks identified in any project, assessing them methodically and responding to them appropriately all form part of your ability to plan these processes properly and with accuracy. Thorough planning indicates preparedness and evidence-based decision making, contributing to the successful implementation of a risk management process.  </p>

                            <h3>Problem-solving skills</h3>
                            <p>
                                Problem-solving skills are core to the effectiveness and success of any project or risk manager. Risk management is essentially a set of activities developed and implemented based on future uncertain events. Creative thinking is required to best deal with unexpected challenges and problems that need to be solved. Creative thinking requires proper immersion through the use of various techniques to really think in-depth about problem solving perspectives before responding to it. Take time to facilitate brainstorming sessions with internal and external stakeholders to find alternative solutions that may be more effective than a single (off the shelf) solution approach you might usually take in assessing and responding to risk.  </p>

                            <p>
                                Risk Management within a project or organisation setting can be highly stressful. Good communication skills are essential in helping you to work effectively, build solid stakeholder relationships, identify, assess and respond to risks appropriately and monitor and review continuously. Successful risk management communication is about open and honest discussion, trust and listening to and responding to feedback. Effective communication is also about considering other points of view before taking an agreed upon action.  </p>

                            <p>
                                Thorough analysis and evaluation in selecting the "best approach" to undertaking and completing risk management activities will inform overall planning, communication, and stakeholder management by clearly articulating the selected path to successfully achieving project objectives. Displaying analytical skills enables you to structure ideas and information logically, find ways to apply information practically. When you pay attention to detail, you develop your analytical skills, which will enable you to identify when something is likely to impact your project objectives.  </p>

                            <p>
                                Process-thinking is a key skill in successful risk management. Process thinking involves your ability to see links between events and situations and how you might go about resolving them. Breaking down a perceived 'big' issue into smaller, more manageable parts, enables you to deal with smaller problems or issues one at a time, resulting in an overall challenge being solved more appropriately and successfully. Having a clear indication of the cause of a problem in the risk management process, enables you to think logically and practically about its effect and therefore you are in a better position to choose responses that are most effective.  </p>
