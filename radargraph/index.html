                <p>To achieve a balanced assessment portfolio in your courses the following feedback may be helpful.</p>
                <p>
                  For improved student learning outcomes assessment should not be considered an ‘add-on’ to the curriculum structure of a course. It needs to be considered from the outset of course design and intimately embedded and linked to considerations of student learning as part of the curriculum. Assessment tasks, types and means of deployment need to be fully aligned with all other aspects of the curriculum.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Many separate low-value pieces of assessment can fragment learning without providing evidence of how students’ knowledge and skills within a course or a program are interrelated. This is often compounded across courses, leading students to experience knowledge as disconnected elements. Strong evidence of achievement of the totality of outcomes can be provided by integrated tasks that require students to demonstrate coherent integrated learning, not isolated or atomistic performance.

                <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

                <p>To improve students understanding of academic integrity and reduce likelihood of academic integrity breaches the following suggestions may be helpful.</p>
                
                <p>For students to become independent and self-managing learners, they need to be supported in the development and acquisition of the skills they need for learning, including those of academic integrity.</p>
                
      

                <p>
                  Academic integrity begins with a commitment to the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility and courage. Discuss these values with your students. Encourage and support the development of academic integrity throughout assessment tasks. Ensure that support resources to referencing guides are available or linked through MyUni course sites. Supporting students to develop an awareness of academic integrity can be supported via the encouragement of the use of tools such as TurnItIn. Academic integrity can be scaffolded throughout assessment design. Encourage students to utilise academic integrity support services such as the Writing Centre or the Library. For further resources to support the development of academic integrity, contact the Academic Integrity Officer,

                <h3>Feedback</h3>
                <p>To improve feedback to students the following suggestions may be helpful.</p>
                <p>
                  Students benefit from clear and helpful feedback on their learning. Everyday learning activities as well as special tasks and tests provide opportunities for the provision of feedback. This places responsibility on staff to plan assessment in order to (a) develop their own skills in providing quality feedback, and (b) develop in students the skills they need to provide sound feedback to each other.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Students’ own skills of judgement are developed by:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>their utilisation of feedback, </li>
                  <li>guidance provided by those already inducted into the culture and standards of the discipline,</li>
                  <li>opportunities to grow their own skills of critical appraisal.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Students need to be able to seek and action feedback from a variety of sources to build their confidence and develop the skills necessary to make informed decision in their specific discipline.</p>
                <p>
                  Marks and grades provide little information to students about specific qualities of their work and do not indicate how it might be improved. While marks and grades may provide a crude tracking measure of how well students are doing, they do not help students to develop as learners and emerging professionals. Specific and detailed feedback is needed to show students what has been done well, what has not, and how their work could be better.

                  Providing students with an opportunity to review the quality of their own work and the work of others enables them to develop the skills of a practitioner. Embedding self-assessment and peer assessment opportunities throughout a course enables students to develop evaluative judgement. If you are interested in learning more about developing evaluative judgement, see  Tai, J., Ajjawi, R., Boud, D. et al.

                <h3>Accessible</h3>
                <p>To improve the accessibility of assessment in your courses the following feedback may be helpful.</p>
                <p>
                  Students commence higher education with great diversity in preparedness and understanding of what will be involved. To ensure that all can engage equitably with assessment tasks, the expectations around what is required for success in any discipline need to be made explicit and accessible to students. It is important to provide opportunities for them to develop the academic skills they require to perform those tasks.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Intentionally designing assessment so that it does not require significant modifications to accommodate individual learners ensures that assessment is inclusive and achievable. One easy way to do this is to use the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-Accessibility-Checker-in-the-Rich-Content/ta-p/820" target="_blank">Accessibility Checker in MyUni</a>. Using this tool regularly will help identify areas for improvement. You may ask a peer to review the instructions for your assessment items to see if they are clear. Consider whether or not assessment tasks are a stepped process. If so, are the steps provided to students in a logical, chronological way? Number the steps clearly. Are instructions for online submission clear to students? These can all be barriers to achieving assessment outcomes. Review the assessment set up in your course prior to the next delivery to see where opportunities for uplift might present.

                <h3>Authentic</h3>
                <p>To increase the authenticity of assessment the following feedback may be helpful.</p>
                <p>
                  Designing assessment tasks that are rich in opportunities for production and that enable students to connect their learning with real world application can motivate students.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To improve student engagement in learning, and to support better quality learning outcomes, it is important that assessment tasks are designed to direct student attention to what needs to be learned and to the activities that best lead to this. Effective learning can be hampered by assessment tasks that focus student attention on grades and marks or reproductive thinking.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Assessment tasks can enable judgements to be made about what has been learned and can also be significant learning activities in themselves. Student engagement in learning is considerably enhanced when assessment tasks require substantial involvement over time, and when they are designed in an interlinked, constructive, organised and coherent sequence.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Consider adding in assessment tasks that reflect practices in industry or mirror activities that students would undertake in the workplace.</p>
