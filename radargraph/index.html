                  Designing assessment tasks that are rich in opportunities for
                  production and that enable students to connect their learning
                  with real world application can motivate students.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To improve student engagement in learning, and to support
                  better quality learning outcomes, it is necessary that
                  assessment tasks are designed to direct student attention to
                  what needs to be learned and to the activities that best lead
                  to this. Effective learning can be hampered by assessment
                  tasks that focus student attention on grades and marks or
                  reproductive thinking.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Assessment tasks should be significant learning activities in
                  themselves, and not only enable judgements to be made about
                  what has been learned. The potency of student engagement in
                  learning is enhanced when assessment tasks require substantial
                  involvement over time, and when they are designed in an
                  interlinked, constructive, organised and coherent sequence.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Consider adding in assessment tasks that reflect practices in
                  industry or mirror activities that students would undertake in
                  the workplace. For further reading in relation to authentic

                  Students come to higher education with great diversity in
                  preparedness and understanding of what it involves. To ensure
                  that all can engage equitably with assessment tasks, the
                  implicit rules and expectations around what is required for
                  success in any discipline need to be made accessible to
                  students and opportunities provided for them to develop the
                  academic skills they require to perform those tasks.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Intentionally designing assessment so that it does not require
                  significant modifications to accommodate individual learners
                  ensures that assessment is inclusive and achievable. You may
                  ask a peer to review the instructions for your assessment
                  items to see if they are clear. Consider whether or not
                  assessment tasks are a stepped process. If so, are the steps
                  provided to students in a logical, chronological way? Number
                  the steps clearly. Are instructions for online submission
                  clear to students? These can all be barriers to achieving
                  assessment outcomes. Review the assessment set up in your
                  course prior to the next delivery to see where opportunities
                  for uplift might present.

                <p>
                  Students benefit from clear and helpful feedback on their
                  learning. Everyday learning activities as well as special
                  tasks and tests provide opportunities for the provision of
                  feedback. This places responsibility on staff to plan
                  assessment in order to (a) develop their own skills in
                  providing quality feedback, and (b) develop in students the
                  skills they need to provide sound feedback to each other.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Students’ own skills of judgement are developed by their
                  utilisation of feedback, guidance provided by those already
                  inducted into the culture and standards of the discipline, and
                  opportunities to grow their own skills of critical appraisal.
                  They need to be able to seek and employ feedback from a
                  variety of sources to develop a full range of outcomes from
                  their studies.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Marks and grades provide little information to students about
                  specific qualities of their work and do not indicate how it
                  might be improved. While marks and grades may provide a crude
                  tracking measure of how well students are doing, they do not
                  help students move beyond their present standard of
                  performance. Specific and detailed information is needed to
                  show students what has been done well, what has not, and how
                  their work could be better.

                  Providing students with an opportunity to review the quality
                  of their own work and the work of others enables them to
                  develop the skills of a practitioner. Embedding
                  self-assessment and peer assessment opportunities throughout a
                  course enables students to develop evaluative judgement. If
                  you are interested in learning more about developing

                  Assessment is not an ‘add-on’ to the curriculum structure of a
                  course. It needs to be considered from the outset of course
                  design and intimately embedded and linked to considerations of
                  student learning as part of the curriculum. Assessment tasks,
                  types and means of deployment need to be fully aligned with
                  all other aspects of the curriculum.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Many separate low-value pieces of assessment can fragment
                  learning without providing evidence of how students’ knowledge
                  and skills from a unit of study are interrelated. This is
                  often compounded across subjects, leading students to
                  experience knowledge as disconnected elements. Strong evidence
                  of achievement of the totality of outcomes can be provided by
                  larger-scale tasks that require students to demonstrate
                  coherent integrated learning, not isolated or atomistic
                  performance.

                <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
                <p>
                  For students to become independent and self-managing learners,
                  they need to be supported in the development and acquisition
                  of the skills they need for learning, including those of
                  assessment. Critical to this attainment is early engagement in
                  manageable assessed tasks to build confidence, and the
                  expectation that learning requires not only an investment of
                  effort but also the taking of initiative. This contributes to
                  alleviating anxiety around assessment information,
                  instructions, guidance, and performance. Early assessment
                  provides information to both students and teachers on progress
                  and achievement, and allows for identification of students in
                  need of additional support.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Academic integrity begins with a commitment to the values of
                  honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility and courage.
                  Discuss these values with your students. Encourage and support
                  the development of academic integrity throughout assessment
                  tasks. Academic integrity can be scaffolded throughout. For
                  further resources to support the development of academic
                  integrity, contact the Academic Integrity Officer,
